# Description of this file



- **QGARCH_1.0.0.tar.gz**: Source code for "QGARCH" package. Please use the following function to install "QGARCH" package from the local file.
  ```
  install.packages("QGARCH_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
  ```

- **QGARCH_1.0.0.pdf**: Reference manual for "QGARCH" package.

- **Rcode_for_QGARCH.html**: This file contains all outputs for real data analysis of Zhu et al. (2022+). Specifically, (1) Model estimation of the QGARCH model based on QR is presented; (2) The figure for coefficient function estimation at multiple quantile levels is provided; (3) To check constant persistence coefficient, the CvM tests are given at multiple quantile ranges; (4) Rolling forecasting and backtests are presented.

- **Rcode_for_QGARCH.Rmd**: Source code for 'Rcode_for_LDAR.html'.
